          <h1>False Summit of South Sister</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-body">
          <p>
            South Sister has been on my bucket list for a while. Thousands of
            people make it to the summit each summer. It is not a technical
            route, does not have any known open craverses, and the slope is
            pretty "mellow". However, this does not mean it is an easy hike, you
            gain over 4,000 ft in just 6 miles, and the real climb potion
            happens in the last 3 miles. Knowing that this is gonna be a
            challenge, I have been training myself on the more difficult trail
            of Spencer Butte, a local moutain in Eugene. My training route gains
            about 1,000 ft in 0.71 miles, which roughly translate to the
            steepest part of South Sister Summit Trail. After training myself
            for about 2 months, I decided to scout the trail on June 12th, my
            plan was to do some route finding, and reach the plateau.

            I left Eugene around 6 in the morning, and it took me about 2.5
            hours to drive to the trail head. As I was getting closer to the
            trail head, I started to get worried because there were a lot of
            clouds hanging over the summit, which could lead to a white out
            condition at higher elevation. After I ate breakfast at the parking
            lot, I started my journey. The first portion of the trail is through
            a forest, since it is the early season, the trail was covered in
            deep snow. I put on my microspikes after about 1/4 mile in when the
            trail started to get steeper. This portion should be very easy in
            the summer when there is no snow, but in early season, some route
            finding is needed to make your way out of this forest.

          <p>
            After I made it out of the forest, I came to the plateau. The best
            part of any climb is to come out of the tree line when the view just
            opens up. I had my first glipse of South Sister at the plataue, the
            moutain was so magnificent. I can see the cloud moving above the
            summit, and everything was so quiet with the snow absorbing the
            sound. My immediate thought was "Am I really going to climb this?".
            Since I felt pretty good in terms of my stamina and did not have any
            altitude sickness, I decided to push myself as far as I can.

          <p>
            The plataue seems to last forever. The snow started to build up
            between my hiking shoes and microspikes, my feet started to get
            cold. I met a guy on skis, which seemed to be a good idea, he was
            cutting through the snow field with ease. After the plateau, the
            real climb began, the slope got significantly steeper as I was
            closer to Lewis glacier, the glacier has a 45 degree incline. As I
            was getting higher up, the view really opened up, every time I look
            back, I can see the whole Cascade range in central Oregon. I also
            switched my hiking poles to my ice axe, which gives me great
            confidence in anchoring down on the slope since my feet started to
            slip. I took my time and did kick step to create a "stair case" on
            the slope. I wish I had crampons, which will help a lot in that
            situation.

          <p>
            After Lewis glacier, the trail flat out a little, and the summit
            became visible. It looked so close, but it was actually almost
            another 1,000 ft up. I started to push myself to the summit, this
            portion requires some scrambling on the screes and large boulders.
            Nothing is stable! I can see the rocks tumbling down after I stepped
            on it. Finally, I made it to the "summit". It looked like a summit,
            but once I looked to the other side, there stands the real summit.
            However, the clouds started to roll in again, I did not want to risk
            it, and started to head back down.

            I glissading down (butt skiing) the steep portion. It was definitely
            the best part of my trip. I had the whole Cascades in front of my
            feet while sliding down the mountain. At certain points, I felt I
            was going a bit too fast, I took the opportunity to practice self
            arrest with ice axe to stop myself. After about 3 hours, I got back
            to my car safely. I was really proud of myself and felt very
            accomplished.
