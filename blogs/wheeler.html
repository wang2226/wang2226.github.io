              Wheeler Peak came onto my radar last summer when I traveled U.S.
              50, a.k.a. the Loniest Road in America. I did not summit last year
              since I got there really late and only hiked to Stella Lake. This
              year, I came back to finish my summit dream. This is probably the
              most accessible 13ers, the trailhead starts at around 10,000 ft
              and almost reach the tree line. I camped in the back of my car at
              the trailhead. This is my first time sleeping at high elevation. I
              had to crack the front windows for more ventilation because I was
              having some hard time breathing in my car.

            The sun woke me up around 6:30, I had some breakfast, packed all my
            gear and headed out for the summit. The first portion of the trail
            is to clear the treeline, the trail is nice and gradual. After about
            2.1 miles, I finally reached the treeline. However, at this point, I
            have only gained about 1,000 vert, which means the rest of the trail
            is going to be really steep.

            After the treeline, the rest of the trail is on an endless scree
            field. To reach the summit, I had to traverse a ridgeline, and then
            scramble all the way up to the summit. The scree field is pretty
            technical, the footing is very important as nothing is stable under
            my feet. Also, as the elevation started to get above 11,000 ft, I
            could feel it started to have a toll on my body. I started to go a
            lot slower and have difficulty of breathing smoothly. The trail
            started to get steeper and steeper, and the summit seemed impossible
            to reach.

            Finally, after I made it to the end of the ridge, I can see the
            summit is within reach. However, at this point, I still have 1,000
            vert to go and it is really steep and technical. I took a longer
            break, and had a fruit bar and energy gel to prepare for the final
            push to the summit. The final push to the summit required steep
            scrambling. Also, when I was about 100 ft below the summit, I lost
            the trail. I had to do some really mad scrambling on loose boulders,
            it was quite nerve wracking. Once I reached the summit, I found a
            mailbox that contains a log book and a sign. Overall it was quite an
            accomplishment being able to summit a 13er.
